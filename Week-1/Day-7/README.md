## Day-7: HTML and CSS crash course

### HTML
```html
Hyper Text Markup Language


<html> 
<head> 
    <!-- Information about the page -->
    <!--This is the comment tag-->
    <title>GeeksforGeeks</title> 
</head> 
<body> 
    <!--Contents of the webpage-->
</body> 
</html> 
```
1. Elements: \<h1> / \<h2> / \<body> / \<head>
2. Attributes: class /id
 
- \<html> : Every HTML code must be enclosed between basic HTML tags. It begins with <html> and ends with </html> tag.

- \<head> : The head tag comes next which contains all the header information of the web page or document like the title of the page and other miscellaneous information. These informations are enclosed within head tag which opens with <head> and ends with </head>. The contents will of this tag will be explained in the later sections of course.

- \<title> : We can mention the title of a web page using the <title> tag. This is a header information and hence mentioned within the header tags. The tag begins with <title> and ends with </title>
  
- \<body> : Next step is the most important of all the tags we have learned so far. The body tag contains the actual body of the page which will be visible to all the users. This opens with <body> and ends with </body>. Every content enclosed within this tag will be shown on the web page be it writings or images or audios or videos or even links. We will see later in the section how using various tags we may insert mentioned contents into our web pages.

### CSS

```css
Cascading Style Sheet


body {
  background: #eeeeee;
  font-family: “Trebuchet MS”, Verdana, Arial, serif;
}
```
* CSS is used to connect to HTML mostly via the class name.
