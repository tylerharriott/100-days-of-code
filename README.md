# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: April 15, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Started to deep deeper into the wonderful world of Javascript. Learned all about If/Else statements, Switch statements, and even Ternary Operators. Also learned, about Truthy and fasly, and equality.

**Thoughts:** First would like to say, Started doing the 100 days of coding challenge today :grin:. Big shoutout to Hugo P. for getting me started. Back to Javascript, so far i am really loving the language. I can see some similarities to Java however, I can also see the differences. I am excited to learn more.

### Day 2: April 16, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Finally touched on the subject of functions, arrays, and objects. Learned how functions are created in javascript as well as objects. Additionally, learned that Javascript arrays don't all have to be of the same type. This is because of type coercion.

**Thoughts:** I really enjoy programming in Javascript. I see more and more differences in the language compared to Java as I learn more and more. Like stated in the progress, I really love that the array elements don't all have to be the same data type. I also brushed my knowledge of functions and using the "this" keyword in methods.

### Day 3: April 17, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Got started on loops and iterations today. Just learned how to incorporate a for loop and a while loop into my code. (:fire: :fire: :fire:)

**Thoughts:** I am really understanding the power of Javascript. It is such a veratile OOP language and has a simple to understand syntax. I hope to continue to get better and will try to write more clean code. Lets see what Day 4 brings!!

#### It may be confusing to understand, but its progress!!

 ### Day 4: April 18, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: I finished the coding challenge for the basics to Javascript. I combined all the information i learned tointo one coding task. (Objects, variables, loops, functions, operators)

**Thoughts:** I didn't realize how hard it is to et aside time to code for at least 1 hour a day. Although hard, I promised to stick through until the very end. I continue to program in Javascript and am activity thinking about becoming a web designer. Lets see where i go next.

### Day 5: April 20, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Learned more about ECMAScript 5. Also, was taught more about Execution Stack and how a Javascript Engine actually operates.

**Thoughts:** The more I program in Javscript, the more I relize how fun coding can really be. I hope to design a application one day that really helps solve a real world issue. Keep coding!!!

### Day 6: April 21, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Learned about the Global Context and Execution Context. Had an in depth review of "Scope Chain" and the "this" keyword. Today was more of a overview of how Javascript works in the back-end. I have been educated more on the theoretical side of Javascript. In turn, this will make me an overall better developer :grin:.

**Thoughts:** Although, I am recently sick I still was able to push through and learn more about how Javascript works. I realize that if I want to become a better developer I can't just know how to code, but also I must know how the back-end or "compiler" of each language operates.

### Day 7: April 22, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Crash course in HTML and CSS. Learnt about how to link up the hmtl attribute identifier class and id.

**Thoughts:** This section of my learning is going to be really enjoyable. I start to actually code and build a website that is interactive. I am finally putting my Javascript basics to use.

### Day 8: April 23, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Starting working on a new Javascript project encompassing everything I have learned so far. I started learning more about Document Object Model(DOM) Manipuation. I am starting to see the bigger picture on how Javascript makes website more interactive for the user.

**Thoughts:** DOM Manipulation is challenging at first, but he more I practice writing the code, the more I will get better. I hope to eventually write this code so frequently that it just becomes second nature. All in all, I really like making websites now and will keep practicing my craft.

### Day 9: April 24, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: I finished up coding up the score features. Calculating the score, switching player turns, and showing the current score.

**Thoughts:** I am stepping closer and closer to finishing my first Javascript based design. I am really proud of myself and the accomplishments I have made so far in this language. I love the ease of use with Javascritpt.

### Day 10: April 25, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: I coded up the hold button. This holds the current round score into the player's final score. Also, I added the "Winner!" message for once a player gets a score equal to 100 or above.

**Thoughts:** I am learning how to not repeat myself in my coding (D.R.Y). When you repeat yourself in coding, you are more likely to write buggy code. This is a useful tip that I will carry on with me when I start developing for work.

### Day 11: April 26, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Today I worked on adding the **New Game** feature into the website. I even simplified my code by using the "D.R.Y" to not repeat myself while coding. I learned more about functions and even how to properly use an Event Handler.

**Thoughts:** Coding is fun!! Nothing much to say today.

### Day 12: April 27, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: I finally finished my first ever Javascript project!!! I learnt so much through my experience of DOM Manipulation and being taught more about functions and scope chain.

**Thoughts:** I will be putting my project in a seperate repo. I have added also some instructions in order for a user to run the script. I am proud of yself and my accomplishments.
