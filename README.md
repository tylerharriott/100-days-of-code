# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: April 15, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Started to deep deeper into the wonderful world of Javascript. Learned all about If/Else statements, Switch statements, and even Ternary Operators. Also learned, about Truthy and fasly. And equality.

**Thoughts:** First would like to say, Started doing the 100 days of coding challenge today :grin:. Big shoutout to Hugo P. for getting me started. Back to Javascript, so far i am really loving the language. I can see some similarities to Java however, I can also see the differences. I am excited to learn more.

### Day 2: April 16, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Finally touched on the subject of functions, arrays, and objects. Learned how functions are created in javascript as well as objects. Additionally, learned that Javascript arrays don't all have to be of the same type. This is because of type coercion.

**Thoughts:** I really enjoy programming in Javascript. I see more and more differences in the language compared to Java as I learn more and more. Like stated in the progress, I really love that the array elements don't all have to be the same data type. I also brushed my knowledge of functions and using the "this" keyword in methods.

### Day 3: April 17, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Got started on loops and iterations today. Just learned how to incorporate a for loop and a while loop into my code. (:fire: :fire: :fire:)

**Thoughts:** I am really understanding the power of Javascript. It is such a veratile OOP language and has a simple to understand syntax. I hope to continue to get better and will try to write more clean code. Lets see what Day 4 brings!!

 ### Day 4: April 18, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: I finished the coding challenge for the basics to Javascript. I combined all the information i learned tointo one coding task. (Objects, variables, loops, functions, operators)

**Thoughts:** I didn't realize how hard it is to et aside time to code for at least 1 hour a day. Although hard, I promised to stick through until the very end. I continue to program in Javascript and am activity thinking about becoming a web designer. Lets see where i go next.
