# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: April 15, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Started to deep deeper into the wonderful world of Javascript. Learned all about If/Else statements, Switch statements, and even Ternary Operators. Also learned, about Truthy and fasly. And equality.

**Thoughts:** First would like to say, Started doing the 100 days of coding challenge today :grin:. Big shoutout to Hugo P. for getting me started. Back to Javascript, so far i am really loving the language. I can see some similarities to Java however, I can also see the differences. I am excited to learn more.
